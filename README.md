# Ohmmeter
A battery powered 6.25 Decade auto ranging ohmmeter, made for the Microprocessor Systems Design class in one quarter. The overall design specifications of the assignment were to measure up to 1MΩ and achieve an accuracy of 0.05% among the middle ranges of 1kΩ to 100kΩ.

Specifications:
* 16 bit signed ADC, with 3 Stage Programmable Gain Amplifier.
* Six Ranges, with Current Steps of 12.50 mA, 1.736 mA, 310.9 uA, 48.04 uA, 8.012 uA, 129.4 nA.
* Maximum measurable value of 2.5MΩ.
* BNC connector and coaxial cable for Noise Rejection.
* Operates down to 3.3V.
* Zeroing Capability.
* Basic input protection and filtering.
* 5 hz refresh rate.
* Powered by an 18650 3.7V Li ion Battery, with a battery life of over 75 hours (Assuming a capacity of 3 Ah).
